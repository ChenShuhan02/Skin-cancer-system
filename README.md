## üìú Abstract
Skin cancer is a prevalent disease with a high global incidence rate. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. This project presents a practical implementation of a **deep learning-based approach** for recognizing skin cancer using the **HAM10000 dataset**. The framework includes three primary modules:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Model Training**
3. **Image Detection**

This study contributes to the field of medical image analysis by providing a user-friendly and efficient tool for skin cancer recognition, which has the potential to assist dermatologists in their clinical practice.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The **HAM10000 dataset**, consisting of 10,000 dermatoscopic images, was used.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**:
  - Converted images to grayscale.
  - Applied **histogram equalization** to enhance contrast.

### 2. Model Training
- Utilized **MobileNetV2** with pre-trained **ImageNet weights**.
- Applied **data augmentation** (rotation, zoom, shifts, and flips) to enhance model generalization.
- The model was trained using the **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of 1e-4.

### 3. Image Detection
- Developed a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Python‚Äôs **Tkinter** library.
- The GUI allows users to:
  - Import skin lesion images.
  - Classify lesions.
  - Display results and evaluate batch testing performance.

## üìä Results
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- The overall **F1-score** of the model was **0.91**, indicating high classification accuracy.

| Class       | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Class 1     | 0.90      | 0.92   | 0.91     | 100     |
| Class 2     | 0.85      | 0.83   | 0.84     | 100     |
| Class 3     | 0.88      | 0.86   | 0.87     | 100     |
| Class 4     | 0.92      | 0.94   | 0.93     | 100     |
| Class 5     | 0.95      | 0.97   | 0.96     | 100     |
| Class 6     | 0.91      | 0.89   | 0.90     | 100     |
| Class 7     | 0.94      | 0.96   | 0.95     | 100     |
| **Overall** |           |        | **0.91** | **700** |

## üîç Literature Review
- **Esteva et al. (2017)** demonstrated that **CNNs** could achieve dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer, outperforming several board-certified dermatologists ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056)).
- **Ronneberger et al. (2015)** introduced **U-Net**, a successful CNN architecture for biomedical image segmentation, laying the foundation for deep learning applications in skin lesion analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è Future Work
1. **Expand Dataset**: Train the model on larger, more diverse datasets for improved generalization.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Explore additional pre-trained models like **ResNet**, **Inception**, and **EfficientNet**.
3. **Model Explainability**: Use techniques such as **Grad-CAM** or **LIME** to provide better model transparency.
4. **Real-Time Classification**: Develop a real-time classification system using smartphone cameras.
5. **Multimodal Data Integration**: Integrate additional data sources like demographic information, medical history, or genetic data.
